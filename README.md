# DBRS-Technical-Project-Josh-Deiner


### Questions To be Answered
#### Find the Overall Top ten complaints in 2017
#### Find the Top ten most Populous Zipcodes 

#### For each borough, how many of each of those 10 complaint types were there in 2017?
#### For each zipcode, how many of each of those 10 types were there in 2017?
#### Create a complainers index that is based on the population of the borough and the complaints they reported

Top Two Questions Addressed Generally.
Three remaining questions addressed in the main files: 

**running_coding/boroughs_top_complaints.ipynb**

**running_coding/indexed-value.ipynb**

**running_coding/zipcodes_comparing_complaints.ipynb**


#### Things still to be addressed (unspecified). 
#### Could have refactored the zipcode/borough functions into smaller more specific functions
#### Did Not Address issue of unspecificed boroughs. I would probably look at a relationship between cities and zipcodes and see if there is a correlation.
#### Their rows cannot be cleaned fully. It would skew the remaining data to elimate the complaints that they reported.
