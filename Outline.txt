Remaining things to do 


Have image fully functional. 

Address Edge Cases:
    ==> Deal With Tracking unspecificied, not great data entry points
    ==> consider more original ways of impression
    ==> ways to make sql like panda comparison to make up for missing data
 
 
Future Proof: 
    ZipCodes/boroughs. put in logical order. inherit so throughout project(ie in zipcode array
    
    
consider adding special data for unspecified missing data. give rationale for why. throw in boroughs 14 missing data points too. 
Go extra mile for this scenario. you took extra time. you need to show that it was okay.

#### probably won't need to worry about excel path. they will just be running image in their thing. has nothing to do with me as long as we can handle jupyter complaints
